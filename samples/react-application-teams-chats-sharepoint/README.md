# Embed Microsoft Teams chats in SharePoint pages

## Summary

This SPFx extension was built to embed Microsoft Teams chats within SharePoint pages to streamline collaboration and information access for users. This application customizer takes advantage of a Microsoft Teams integration made by Microsoft for Edge where links shared in chats open with the conversation context next to it in the browser. Using this solution you can bring the same feature to your SharePoint pages.
