The application button may be added in two locations. The first one (default) uses standard spfx PlaceholderName.Top region.

The second one (not recommended approach as it uses HTML as API) presents the flow icon in the Suite Navigation Placeholder (in order to change the mode set headerButtonRegion to true).
