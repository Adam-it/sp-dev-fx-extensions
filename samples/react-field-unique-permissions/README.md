## Debug URL for testing

Here's a debug URL for testing around this sample. Notice that this sample is designed to be used with **Text** field type. In below debug URL sample we define the field internal name as **UniquePermissions**.

```
?debugManifestsFile=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4321%2Ftemp%2Fmanifests.js&loadSPFX=true&fieldCustomizers=%7B%22UniquePermissions%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22e0424f4f-5973-492b-aa7c-b8d00fc1a6a0%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D%7D
```

The **UniquePermissions** field would be available after deployment and installation of SPFx package to the app catalog.
